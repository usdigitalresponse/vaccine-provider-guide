# How is this guide different?

1. Agencies and associations like the CDC, CTSE, ASTHO, NACCHO, and APHL are sharing strong guidance on **what** to do. But relatively few organizations are sharing guidance on **how** to implement this guidance. **USDR's approach is to give you concrete tips on the** _**hows of vaccine management**_**–especially through a practical technology lens–so you can continue making life-saving decisions, faster and easier.**
2. A common theme we’ve heard from providers is they are interested in what other providers are doing. Since we’ve partnered with several government providers across the country, **our guide is a way to quickly learn the tips and pitfalls that other government providers have experienced**. Our recommendations are based on conversations and partnerships with government providers like you who are responsible for on-the-ground

    for delivering vaccines to their residents.

3. **We provide actionable and free vaccination administration tools that you can set up today**. USDR recently launched [a free, easy-to-deploy website template](https://vaccinestemplate.wordpress.com/) that enables public health agencies to stand up a resident-facing website within a few hours, and customizable to your needs. We elaborate more on this tool in the Key Areas: [8.
