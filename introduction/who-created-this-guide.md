# Who created this guide?

This guide was created by a team of public health and technology volunteers at U.S. Digital Response. The authors of this guide 1\) have directly supported multiple cities, counties, and state governments on their COVID vaccination planning, 2\) have performed detailed evaluations of multiple vendors in the vaccine provider space, and 3\) collectively have decades of experience directly building and evaluating tech tools. 

[U.S. Digital Response](https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/our-work/) \(USDR\) is a nonprofit that is providing free support to government departments across the US on anything that is affected by the COVID crisis \(e.g. unemployment insurance, food assistance\), and the [USDR Health Program](https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/our-offerings/health-program/) is focused specifically on supporting public health officials and policymakers on direct COVID-19 response.
