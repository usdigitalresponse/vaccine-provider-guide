# Common User Interface Issues

We have seen a number of patterns in the user interface and design of various systems. The below recommendations are general best practices that we have observed and heard about from users of these systems - where there are quotes, these are from actual system end-users. 

Where possible, consider the below when deciding between vendors, or if you already work with a vendor, consider sending them these recommendations as suggested changes.

      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>The public is repeatedly coming back to vaccine scheduling sites to check
          availability and find information. Even small improvements in how forms
          collect information can greatly improve the site&apos;s user experience.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Only collect information relevant to where the user is in the scheduling
            process. For example:
            <ul>
              <li>When determining vaccine eligibility, don&apos;t collect insurance information
                if it is not necessary to determine eligibility</li>
              <li>If your system is not pre-registering people and there are no available
                appointments, don&apos;t ask for eligibility information</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Let people create accounts to avoid having to re-enter eligibility and
            other information each time they check appointment availability.</li>
          <li>Links to schedule appointments should be unique to recipient or enforce
            eligibility requirement in some way. Generic links to scheduling systems
            can easily be shared and create logistical problems at vaccination locations.</li>
          <li>Language choice should be part of the form. Systems should use language
            choice for emails, texts, and/or calls to people.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Improve communication</b>

        <p></p>

      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>Given the highly fragmented systems users face in many jurisdictions,
          clear and regular communication can often address users&apos; highest level
          of concerns and relieve anxiety. Clearer communication can also prevent
          users from feeling like they need to register multiple times, or in multiple
          places.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use a system to communicate with people after they register: email, text,
            calls.</li>
          <li>Include a process for people to see where they stand in line within the
            system. Even if further back in line, just being able to see where they
            stand within the system lets the user know that they are not being ignored,
            forgotten, or lost.</li>
          <li>Ensure there is one location people can visit and have that information
            updated daily.
            <ul>
              <li>&quot;Make it so everyone could have access to the same information. Because
                I know people who have gotten vaccines because they knew to check certain
                things.&quot;</li>
              <li>&quot;I think every social service office needs to be telling people.
                I think it needs to be on billboards on the more impoverished side of town....
                The people that can afford to jump the line...they&apos;re getting their
                vaccines.&quot;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Often, the patient receiving the vaccine may not be the primary point
            of contact for the appointment. There are a myriad of reasons for this:
            accessibility issues, lack of technical fluency, language barriers, lack
            of resources (e.g. laptop, smartphone, or even time). Allow a secondary
            point of contact to be easily established.
            <ul>
              <li>&quot;Many don&apos;t have the mobility in their hands to do this....
                [One person the vaccine hunter group is helping] has arthritis in her fingers.
                They&apos;re bent over...There is just no way that she could type! Even
                phone calls. Like she can&apos;t really get to her phone calls because
                her fingers just don&apos;t allow it. &quot;</li>
              <li>&quot;The translation of the sites: horrendous. No-one is proofreading
                them. No-one is checking the level of Spanish. No-one is checking the accuracy.&quot;</li>
              <li>&quot;[My mother&apos;s] tech-fluency is not that great...she couldn&apos;t
                [schedule an appointment] herself.&quot;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Unfortunately, simply having a website is insufficient. To maximize outreach,
            especially to underserved communities and those disproportionately affected,
            we recommend having both a digital presence and a call center for people
            to contact for help. In addition, offering multiple channels of communication
            (web, email, text, call) and allowing users to select their preferences
            has the greatest chance of minimizing accessibility issues. There are still
            cases where these channels may fail, and more proactive methods may be
            necessary. For example, <a href="https://sfhealthnetwork.org/covid-19-vaccine/">San Francisco Health Network</a>,
            the public healthcare system for the City and County of San Francisco,
            offers walk-in vaccination sites for qualifying individuals. Thus, individuals
            who have problems jumping through the various hoops still have an option
            if they cannot find the help to overcome resource barriers.
            <ul>
              <li>&quot;I gave up doing it online at that point...and then I started pursuing
                phone calls and that is how I ultimately got my appointment.... I called
                individual sites.&quot;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Another example of proactive outreach methods is <a href="https://unitedinhealth.org/">United in Health in San Francisco</a>,
            an academic-community-city partnership organization which actually goes
            door-to-door to collect information of people specifically in their community.
            The information collected is then used to prioritize and reserve slots
            for walk-up appointments at their vaccination site.</li>

      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>Pre-registering, especially in a way that results in a single centralized
          queue, often reduces operational complexity and results in more positive
          user experiences.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>There is value to <em>any</em> user to know that they are captured by a
            queue and not overlooked, even if their turn in the queue is not immediate.
            Thus, we recommend allowing users to pre-register even if they aren&apos;t
            eligible yet under the current eligibility phase. Clear communication about
            expected vaccine availability, even if weeks or months away, can ease anxiety.
            A more comprehensive queue also provides maximum visibility to the jurisdiction
            to understand and plan for the needs of its population.</li>
          <li>During pre-registration process, collect the minimum set of information
            necessary. We recommend collecting preferred language, preferred method
            of contact, and basic demographic information. This will maximize the chance
            of a successful outreach should the jurisdiction need to contact the patient.
            By proactively collecting basic demographic information, the jurisdiction
            can monitor for accessibility/equity issues or concerns.</li>
          <li>To the extent possible, obscure the complexity of scheduling from the
            user. Some jurisdictions have moved away from a &quot;first come first
            serve&quot; model (which puts the entire onus of scheduling on the patient)
            and instead have embraced a &quot;centralized outreach&quot; model where
            the jurisdiction works directly with the provider to fill appointment slots
            from a centralized queue. This change has been successful at minimizing
            scheduling issues. For example, in New Mexico, a significant percentage
            of providers have opted into the State&apos;s centralized system, and patients
            in New Mexico have largely been shielded from the frustrating experiences
            of navigating the myriad of websites and disparate sets of information
            in their hunt for a vaccination appointment.
            <ul>
              <li>&quot;The difference between all the different sites is mind-boggling...Each
                one has its own system.&quot;</li>
            </ul>
