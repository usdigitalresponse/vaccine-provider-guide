# Choose vendors to evaluate

There are many vendors out there.

**Here are some tips on who to consider first**

* Talk to vendors you currently use \(e.g. your EMR, scheduling tools for COVID testing\) to see if they have add on solutions that can work for the vaccine rollout. This may save you time in procurement and integrating solutions.
* Consider tools that other counties have used or are using.
* If youâ€™d like to get support from USDR in vendor selection or see our detailed vendor evaluations, [please reach out](https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/request-help/).
