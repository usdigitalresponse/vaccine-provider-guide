### Patient information

* What information do they collect?
* How would they track whether this is the patient’s first or second dose, and what brand they’re using?
* Do they integrate with EMRs? If so do they integrate with the one you use?
* Do they integrate with IISs? If so do they integrate with the one you use?
* What are their data exploring functionalities?

### Waivers

* Are they able to collect and report \(if applicable\) signatures on fully digital forms?

### Insurance

* Do they collect insurance information?
* Do they have a way to scan insurance cards?
* Do they have a way to bill insurance companies on your behalf?
* What happens if someone doesn’t have insurance?

### Eligibility screener

* Do they have a way to ask whether the resident is eligible to receive vaccines?
* Do they have a way to upload eligibility information? \(e.g. ID card\)

### Resident experience

* What’s the overall flow?
* What languages do they automatically translate?
