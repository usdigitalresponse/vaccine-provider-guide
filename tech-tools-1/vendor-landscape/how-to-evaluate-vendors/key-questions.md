# Key questions

Given the rapidly evolving vendor landscape and the unique challenges with COVID vaccinations, here are some questions to keep in mind as you do vendor evaluations.

        <p>Understand the vendor&apos;s past government experience. If a vendor hasn&apos;t
          supported situations similar to yours, it&apos;ll likely be a lot of work
          to get what you want out fo them, and there are likely some gotchas that
          neither of you are aware of. It&apos;ll make your life easier to use a
          tool that has proven functionality solving similar problems in the past.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Having experience with wide-scale COVID testing is the gold standard,
          since many of the requirements for COVID testing and COVID vaccinations
          are similar.</p>

          <li>The medical sector?</li>
          <li>COVID?</li>

        <p>How many customers do you already have signed on to use your tool for

        <p><b>What capabilities are they offering?</b> 
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>Be clear on timeline of capabilities: &#x201C;available right now&#x201D;
          vs. &#x201C;near future&#x201D; vs. &#x201C;maybe later.&#x201D; If you
          absolutely need a capability, make sure it is in the &#x201C;available
          right now&#x201D; bucket.
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>Understand the experience for each type of person using the tool. E.g.
          sometimes a tool will be great for residents to use but terrible for administrators&#x2019;
          data reporting needs - ask to see both in the demo.</p>

        <p></p>
        <p>It&#x2019;s unlikely any product will fulfill your needs perfectly out
          of the box, so make sure the vendor will support you in implementation,
          rollout, and in the early days of multi-user usage.</p>

        <p>What kind of day-to-day support do you provide? How can I get help (email,

        <p>What are your contractual SLAs (Service Level Agreements, e.g., resolution
          rates, and speed they commit to clients)? What are the consequences if
          you don&#x2019;t meet SLAs?</p>

      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p><b>How are their operations scaling? </b>
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Many vendors have been receiving an influx of business due to COVID, which
          can affect how well they provide support to you (for example, customer
          support might be slow to respond to emails because they are overwhelmed
          by requests).</p>

      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p><b>Is the tool reliable?</b> 
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Many vendors are seeing much higher day-to-day product usage than prior
          to COVID. Unexpectedly heavy usage can cause the tool to crash or be really
          slow.</p>

        <p>Across all customers for this tool, how many transactions are you dealing

        <p>What kind of load-testing have you done? (&#x201C;Load-testing&#x201D;
          simulates how the tool will perform under heavy usage. If they don&#x2019;t
          have heavy customer usage currently, insist they do this before committing
          to them.)

        </p>
        <p>What&#x2019;s been your application&#x2019;s up-time over the last few
          months? (up-time is how often the site is running and unavailable, e.g.,
          Google&#x2019;s site is up 99.978% of the time)</p>

        <p>What are the ongoing fees? And is the fee per site, per resident, per
          provider, etc?
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>What is the per-hour cost for custom work? What circumstances would require
          custom work? Based on what you&#x2019;ve heard about my situation, do you
          expect custom work will be required? Do you have an estimate for how many
          hours might be required?

        </p>

        <p>You can ask specific questions to get at this, but keep asking this question
          throughout your evaluations. For example, a smooth sales meeting doesn&#x2019;t
          necessarily mean that they&#x2019;ll be able to deliver, but a disorganized
          / unaccommodating meeting is a red flag on their operating ability.</p>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>How long have you been operating? How many employees are part of the company?
          How much have you been growing over the last year? What&#x2019;s the background
          of your leaders / investors?
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>Do you have examples of success stories? customer testimonials to share?
          Customer referrals?
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>In what ways do you think you shine? Who are your competitors, and how
          are you differentiated from them? (They likely will have a guarded response,
          but this is a way to understand how they view their offering compared to
          competitive alternatives.)</p>

Since the two focus areas we’ve repeatedly heard from government partners right now are: 1\) scheduling/queue management and reminder tools and 2\) patient registration tools, we’ve included additional detailed questions for both in the following sections. 

And we’ve already evaluated several vendors and are happy to share our candid reviews. We’re also happy to hop on the phone with a vendor and help you evaluate a vendor. Just [let us know](https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/request-help/).
