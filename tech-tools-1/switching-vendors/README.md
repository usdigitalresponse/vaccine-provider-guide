# Switching Vendors

A trend we have observed is that a lot of jurisdictions are switching vendors. Some of the reasons for this are described below

* Jurisdictions implemented stop gap solutions for scheduling and want to switch to end to end solutions that provide integrations and other functionality.
* Solutions in place did not function or scale as expected.
