# Key Areas

We’ve identified 8 key areas for COVID-19 vaccine providers, based on our conversations with City, County, and State government teams who are responsible for administering vaccinations. Our focus is on the work needed for [open POD operations](https://www.cdc.gov/cpr/readiness/healthcare/closedPODtoolkit.htm#:~:text=Understanding%20Points%20of%20Dispensing,-Points%20of%20dispensing&text=Closed%20PODs%20are%20sites%20staffed,and%20should%20be%20used%20simultaneously). 

We see the high-level ecosystem in the following diagram:
