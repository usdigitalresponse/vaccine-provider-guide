# 3. Collecting patient information

While you may already collect patient information, there may be some additional requirements that are unique for administering the COVID-19 vaccine:

**Reasons to collect patient information**

1. **Reporting** to the state IIS.
2. **Billing** residents’ insurance provider or creating reports of uninsured patients for reimbursement later.
3. **Tracking:** Keeping track of who was given the vaccine, who needs a second dose, and the brand of the doses.
4. **Identifying eligibility:** Patient medical information can be used to identify who falls into specific phases \(e.g. residents with co-morbidities\).
5. **Ensuring equitable access:** Patient demographic information can give you visibility into whether you are equally serving all segments of your population, and help ensure that certain demographics don't fall through the cracks.

**Here are a couple ways to collect patient information**

* **\(Recommended\) Upfront, at the time of scheduling:** This will make on-site logistics smoother and also save time on data entry
* **Collect this information on-site via paper forms or electronically:** Even if you try to collect information ahead of time, you’ll likely still need to collect patient information \(e.g., any patient symptoms\) on-site for some residents.
