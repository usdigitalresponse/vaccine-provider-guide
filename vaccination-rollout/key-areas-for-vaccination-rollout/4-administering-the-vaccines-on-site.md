# 4. Administering vaccines on-site

There are a plethora of on-site operational challenges, including finding appropriate sites, recruiting and training workers, mitigating operational bottlenecks, and ensuring climate controlled vaccine storage. However, our focus is on technology systems and considerations.

**Some technology and tools tips**

* **Internet:** Make sure the site has good internet service and consider getting some backup internet pucks.
* **Scheduling:** Schedule residents for their second vaccine dose appointment while they are on-site getting their first shot. This will likely increase your overall 2-dose completion rates and save you precious time following up with them later.
* **Paper forms:** Have paper printouts of forms available in case residents did not fill out information ahead of time.
* **Handouts:** As you ramp up sites, print out copies about your vaccine administration schedule, patient eligibility criteria, and vaccine brand information in case you have any digital-related hiccups.
* **Access and training:** Make sure your additional staff and volunteers have the right access and training to use your technology tools \(and new licenses are within your budget\) in advance.
