# Public communication templates & resources

We created public communications-focused templates and resources to support your vaccination messaging:

* [Free county website template](free-county-website-template.md). Stand up a resident-facing vaccination communication platform within a few hours.
* [USDR research on at-risk and vulnerable communities](usdr-research-on-at-risk-and-vulnerable-communities.md). Nationwide, primary, qualitative research to explore how at-risk and vulnerable\* communities receive critical COVID information.
* [Guidance from public health practioners](guidance-from-public-health-practioners.md). Guidance and sample messaging to communicate about the COVID vaccine and build trust with the public.
* [Helpful government sites](helpful-government-sites.md). Helpful references for communicating the importance of the vaccine, accessibility to residents, and eligibility phases.
