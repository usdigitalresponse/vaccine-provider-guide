# Key considerations for messaging

We created public communications-focused templates and resources to support your vaccination messaging:

For effective messaging, here are the key considerations: 

* Information to include on website and communications: 
  * Which resident demographics fall into which tiered phases
  * Which phase\(s\) is/are currently eligible
  * How eligible residents should sign up for vaccine
  * Where residents should go to receive vaccine
  * What residents should bring on-site
  * \(If applicable\) Eligible residents’ contraindications
  * Contingency planning for residents \(e.g. how residents can check for vaccination administration changes due to events like inclement weather\)
* Explanatory content can build understanding and trust: convey that the vaccines are safe and free for everyone, vaccine access is based on ethical considerations, and it’s important for everyone to get vaccinated.
* Partner with local news outlets to maximize residents’ awareness of vaccination administration and eligibility.
